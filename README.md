Performing Data analysis to predict Diabetes

About Dataset:
Details about the dataset: The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant 
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in
an oral glucose tolerance test 
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) 
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) BMI:
Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) 
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetespedigree function 
Age: Age (years) 
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
